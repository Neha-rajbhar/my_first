what is the difference between git stash apply and git stash pop

Both of them are used to apply the changes that was removed by using stash command
but the main difference between is git stash apply the most recently removed changes to working directly
but it does not remove them from the stash.

git stash pop also applies the most recently changes to working directory, but it also removes the changes the stash.
means that we can only apply the same set of changes once using git stash pop
